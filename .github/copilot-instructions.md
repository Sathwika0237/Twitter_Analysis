# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be for a Twitter analysis project. The current structure is minimal, with only a `README.md` present and no code or data files yet. The project is likely in its initial setup phase.

## Key Files & Directories
- `README.md`: Project description and documentation. Update this file as the project evolves.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: This file (you are reading it) should be updated as the codebase grows to reflect new conventions and workflows.

## Getting Started
- If you add code, use clear directory structures (e.g., `src/`, `data/`, `notebooks/`, etc.) and document major components in the README.
- Prefer Python for analysis scripts unless otherwise specified.
- Add requirements or environment setup instructions in a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` as soon as dependencies are introduced.

## Conventions & Patterns
- Follow standard Python project conventions for new files (PEP8, docstrings, etc.).
- Place analysis scripts in a `src/` or `scripts/` directory.
- Store datasets in a `data/` directory, and notebooks in a `notebooks/` directory.
- Document any non-standard workflows or build steps in the README.

## Workflows
- No build or test workflows are currently defined. Add instructions for running analysis, tests, or scripts as the project develops.
- If using Jupyter notebooks, document kernel/environment setup in the README and ensure reproducibility.

## Integration Points
- Document any external APIs (e.g., Twitter API) or data sources in the README when added.
- Note any authentication or configuration requirements for external integrations.

## Updating This File
- As the codebase grows, update this file to reflect:
  - Major components and their responsibilities
  - Key developer workflows (build, test, run)
  - Project-specific conventions
  - Integration points and dependencies
